Bloom Player is a MP3 player to play your favorite songs.

## Prerequisites
To run Bloom Player on your device, make sure you have the following packages installed.

 - pygame

  To install them at once, run `pip install pygame mutagen` in your terminal.
  The rest of the packages are already installed, so there will be no need to install them.
